        <p>Area 51 or more precisely entry to it has always been one of the places I always wanted to visit. There are many stories about it online, some outdated, other obviously hoaxes and rumours. I decided to check it out myself. By that of course I mean check it out outside, without any attempts to enter.</p>
<blockquote><p>Area 51 is a remote tract of land in the southwestern portion of southern Nevada in the western United States. Situated at its center, on the southern shore of Groom Lake, a dry lakebed (salt lake), is a large military airfield and one of the most secretive places in the world. The base's primary purpose is to support development and testing of experimental aircraft and weapons systems. src: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_51</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p>Following is a short illustrated story that you can use as a guide to get to the gates of the forbidden zone.</p>
<p>Thus, September 1st, Labour Day, nothing to do. I was on my way from LA eastbound. Visiting Area 51 definitely sounded like good time on a day off.</p>
<p>There wasn't much preparation to do. Pretty much I was preparing mentally as I was approaching Las Vegas on Interstate 15. Stopped at a gas station and picked up Nevada detailed map, bought some water supplies, filled up my tank and made sure my camera battery is charged. On the laptop I had various websites opened in tabs of Firefox with different versions on how to reach mysterious Groom Lake entry.</p>
<p>There are a few entry points. I decided to go to northeastern near Rachel,NV.</p>

<p>The road went a bit to the right and up the hill and I saw the signs reading &quot;NO ENTRY BEYOND THIS POINT, blabla, DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED&quot;. And on a hill to my right there was that pickup truck. I couldn't see if there were people inside or not but it was pretty intimidating. I came to a full stop and stood there for about 10 seconds reading the signs pretending to be lost, while nervously glancing at the white pickup truck. Then I turned around and slowly drove off. I looked in the mirrors and did not notice anything going on behind me. White truck stood still and I was almost relaxed. I drove for maybe 2 miles passing that tent again.</p>

<p>One more mile heading away and I felt pretty relaxed and happy that nothing bad happened! I decided to pull over and take some pics of my car. It was very dusty, I could see that paint wasn't even shiny anymore covered in a dust. So as I opened the door about to get out but by accident I noticed a car behind me. Maybe half mile or so away. I instantly shut the door and sat there for a second thinking.</p>
<p>From the entry to Area 51 to the point where I was there were no side roads. So this car came either from forbidden area or offroaded from the fields.</p>

Approaching black mailbox again I saw some other car coming towards me, it was red SUV type of car, but it kept on going towards Groom Lake Rd. and did not bother me.<br />

<p>I am happy that my trip ended well. Maybe some time in the future when I am better prepared I can hike up the mountain to some remote place where you can actually see Groome Lake base.</p>
<p>This obviously did not appear to be regular Air Force base. I had been to a number of Air Force bases as well as lived next to one at one point. Obviously they do something there that general public shouldn't know for one or another reason. And I understand and respect that. What's interesting is that The U.S. government does not acknowledge the existence of the Groom Lake facility, nor does it deny it.</p>

      <p>ok,<br />
If area51 got such so many tech stuff, why they don't break youtube and delete this vids?<br />
Because every movie u shot, it's not important to them. So, u could stop, talking to them but i don't think they could force u to  confiscate all ur work stuff.</p>
<p>Why they are hiding all this things? Why is this a big secret. Look around u, so many disasters, so many bad things, makes me think that revealing the true face of Area 51 will make a better place of this planet.<br />
 Or a 3rd World War,of course... :laugh:</p>

      <p>So you really think you were being followed? thats nuts man. If you had someone with you, some weapons, and maybe some really big balls you should have turned around to talk to them to find out what was going on :)</p>
<p>still, kinda nuts!</p>
<p>nice pics too!</p>

      <p>Hey Rakia, you know I am quite convinced that I was. When I stopped, that car stopped too maybe with 5 seconds delay. That seems to be typical behavior if you're following somebody.</p>
<p>In fact, if I didn't have my work equipment with me in my car, I would do precisely that, stop and try to talk to them. But I couldn't risk having my work stuff confiscated.</p>
<p>What will not leave my mind is that tent setup 2 miles from entry to the forbidden zone. I just think about it now and it's suspeciously close to the road and all the coolers, bottles of water and stuff look as though they were setup to give an impression of someone camping. I don't know what purpose it would serve. But I just can't stop thinking about it.</p>
<p>Why don't you show this link to your step-dad and ask him if he knows what's going on?</p>
