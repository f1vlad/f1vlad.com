<p>$200 Home Theatre</p>

<p><em>Task</em><br>Build a computer-based home theatre for as little price as possible.</p>



<p></p>

</div>



<div id="projectdescription"><p>An inexpensive home theatre. This small project came into life when I realised my TV is too small for XXI century. I could afford big TV, but I thought it's still too expensive. After looking at a bigger picture, I realised that I watch a lot of TV from my computer (eg. <a href="http://www.russiantvonline.com" target="_blank">russiantvonline.com</a>, <a href="http://video.google.com" target="_blank">video.google.com</a>, <a href="http://www.russianny.com/newdesign/TV" target="_blank">russianny.com/newdesign/TV</a> and other video-on-demand websites.) This is where idea of making TV from a computer came into life.<br />
<br />
Thus, I didn't need a whole lot of parts. I already had a couple of computers. All I needed was (1)an LCD screen to capture an 'image' from computer and (2)a way to project a picture on the wall.<br />
<br />
Ingredients:<br />
<br />
1. <a href="http://benq.com" target="_blank">Benq</a> 15" LCD monitor. Purchased from <a href="http://www.daystarinc.com" target="_blank">Daystar Computer Services</a> for $150.<br />
2. <a href="http://www.acco.com/" target="_blank">Apollo</a> Overhead Projector. Purchased from <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=7596834223&rd=1&sspagename=STRK:MEWN:IT&rd=1" target="_blank">ebay.com</a> for $36.02.<br />
____________________________________<br />
Total: $186.02 (round up to $200)<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: One might ask <strong>"Why bother if you could purchase an LCD projector?"</strong><br />
A: The answer is <strong>price</strong>. LCD projector costs from $700. My home made one costs $200 + few hours of my labour.<br />
<br />
Q: Why does projected picture have too much redness in it?<br />
A: Because the wall in my living room is red. Obviously you will want to project on plain white wall, write board, etc.<br />
<br />
Q: How much heat does LCD get?<br />
A: Good question. There's a lot of heat attacking LCD now, enough to damage it. I am working on a cooling fan that will be permanently fabricated to the box.</p>
