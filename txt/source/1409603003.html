<h1>How to get a 603 Google Voice phone number</h1>
<time>1409603003</time>

<p>For few years now, I wanted to get a 603 phone number on a beloved google's service <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a>. Every once in a while, when bored, I'd hit voice.google.com and check availability of a 603 phone number, just to see a familiar "There are no 603 area code numbers available at this time." Seldom, I would try to actually attempt to port my 603 regular cell phone number with same results... until one day Google let me port my number!<p>

<p>As an aside, I'd like to say that the reason I eagerly wanted to move my favourite 603 number of last 10 years was because of T-Mobile. At one point I moved between few carriers just to return to T-Mobile. They said my phone number is gone. After long argument, they managed to return me my original phone number. More on how T-Mobile can loose your phone number is at the end of the article.</p>

<p>So, to the point, below is how to move your phone number to Google Voice:</p>

<ul>
    <li>switch your current plan to pre-paid T-Mobile;</li>
    <li>go to <a href=\"http://voice.google.com\">voice.google.com</a> and choose to port your phone number;</li>
    <li>pay $20 to google;</li>
    <li>wait 24-48 hours and it's done.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that this has only been verified on T-Mobile pre-paid. It has been verified that Sprint will not allow you to do the same operation.</p>

<p>Once successful, return to your T-Mobile local store and request a new sim card for your pre-paid account. What happened to me at this step was T-Mobile mistakenly gave me someone else's phone number. I've got few phone calls from original owner of this temporary and throw-away (for me) phone number. The person said she'd talk to T-Mobile herself. </p>

<p>So all in all, this operation costs you about $30 ($20 Google's fee and $10 T-Mobile's fee).</p>
